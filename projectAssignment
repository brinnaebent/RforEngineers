Project Assignment
==================

For the final project, you will create a project in R. 

You can create a project using the tools we covered in class as well as others you may learn along the way (i.e. APIs, ML, Shiny App)


For successful project completion, you must:
1. Create a GitHub repository to document your code (How to: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
2. Create a README.md about the project- include description, helpful links, data source (if not generated by you), and code outline
3. Provide *well commented* code(s)
4. Write a brief description of what you learned (include at the end of the README)
5. Upload Link under RforEngineers/Issues/PROJECTS
6. Evaluate 2 other projects, provide feedback on code methods in Issues comments.
