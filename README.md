# RforEngineers
Digital Pedagogy Final Project

About the course:
=================
R is a statistical programming language not commonly taught to engineers. Engineers would benefit from having knowledge of this powerful statistical software. 

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS, making it an ideal platform for all your statistical computing needs. In this course, we will explore this platform: discussing the basics of getting started in R, working through computations in data analysis, and basic statistics, and visualization. The course will culminate in a final project where you will use R for a project you are currently working on. 

Learning Objectives:
====================
1. Develop a basic understanding of the R language, perform simple operations, and use Rmarkdown
2. Apply basic statistics in R and solve basic computations in the swirl library tutorials
3. Compare and contrast visualizations and plotting libraries in R and apply this knowledge to developing succinct plots
4. Construct a project utilizing key components from the course (statistics, analysis, and visualizations)
